1. That Bishops in England may and ought to Vote in Causa Sanguinis, and that they were never Inhibited by any Law of this Land, or the Lay-Peers so to do, before this time, and that their voluntary forbearance heretofore to sentence in this Case, proceeded from their own Fears of the Canons and Court of Rome, and some private ends they then had. And by the special leave of the King, and both Houses in plein Parliament, who were gratiously pleased to allow of their Protestations for their Indemnity, as Church-men, when they might have rejected their said Protestations if they had pleased. With some Answers to the Objections of the Bishop of Lincoln.
